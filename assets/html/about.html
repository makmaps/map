            This is a space for learning! For tripping and stumbling through
            spatial database analysis and asking every question that comes to
            mind, regardless of how silly it may sound. For writing powerful SQL
            queries that help to quickly uncover answers in half the time it
            might take our ESRI software to open. Above all, this is a space to
            share mapping apps however loud our puny human brain screams to
            stop~ Welcome!

          <p>
            Hi, I'm Makenzie! I am a spatial data wizard, a web mapping extraordinaire, 
            a sometimes project manager, and certified goofball who has married my 
            knowledge of GIS, databases, client and server side programming to
            answer questions about the world around us. I am passionate about
            creating beautiful, interactive and easy to understand visualizations, 
            stories and online mapping products. 
            Relying as much as I can on open source technologies and spatial databases, 
            I enjoy exploring trends and patterns, such as examining what 
            land has changed over time, or modeling what if scenarios, 
            such as how adding a new road to an existing network will effect 
            traffic patterns and noise pollution.</p>
          <p>
            I currently live in West Cape May, New Jersey with my fellow geographer boyfriend
            and our two cats. I enjoy being active- biking, hiking and paddling around Cape
            Island during the warmer months. Come winter, you can find me traveling north
            to the mountains in search of powder. I am an active member of my local
            Environmental Commission and do my best to live as sustainably as possible, 
            building a strong community and making meaningful connections with whoever
            crosses my path.
