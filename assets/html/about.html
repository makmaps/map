          <p>
            Hi, I'm Makenzie! I am a spatial data analyst, a web mapper,and
            a sometimes project manager who has intertwined my 
            knowledge of GIS, databases, client and server side programming to
            answer questions about the world around us. I am passionate about
            creating beautiful, interactive and easy to understand visualizations, 
            stories and online mapping products. 
            Relying as much as I can on open source technologies and spatial databases, 
            I enjoy exploring trends and patterns, such as examining what 
            land has changed over time, or modeling what if scenarios, 
            such as how adding a new road to an existing network will effect 
            traffic patterns and noise pollution.</p>
          <p>
            I currently live in West Cape May, New Jersey with my partner
            and our two cats. I enjoy being active- biking, hiking and paddling around Cape
            Island during the warmer months. Come winter, you can find me traveling north
            to the mountains in search of snow. I am an active member of my local
            Environmental Commission and do my best to live as sustainably as possible, 
            building a strong community and making meaningful connections with whoever
            crosses my path.
